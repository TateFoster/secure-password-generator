# secure-password-generator

## Description

This was a project to make it so that when a button was clicked on the page it would automatically create a random password based on criteria that the user would select. These criteria ranged from a length between 8 to 128 characters, to what types of characters to include (lowercase, uppercase, numerials, and special characters). In my coding the first third deals with the creation of the variables to be used in making the password, with the final two thirds being first, a short function to randomly pick out characters from the selected variables for use and then, the rest was using a switch statement to orginaize and evaulate the password agaisnt the users selected criteria to make sure that no matter the length it had at least one character from each criteria the user chose.
